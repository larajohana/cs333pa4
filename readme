Johana Lara

For this assignment Maria and Johana worked together
aiding each other in the development of the Assignment 4:
registrar application: Web Version 2. Maria this time around,
focused more on the fixing of bugs and previous errors.
She also focused more on the testing of the application, 
monitoring the overall fix of the application and
editing the main errors that were the result of points lost on
things we had been programming throughout the past weeks. 
Johana took a lead on the main formatting of the app.
She helped with the creation of the app without the 
submit button.

In the later portions of the assignment, Maria and Johana 
worked together to fix final bugs and attempt to figure out testing
with the program provided. Together, Maria and Johana collaborated to 
fix previous errors as noted in the past two assignments. 
For this application, Johana 
and Maria did not go to any lab TA's or consult any outside physical 
sources for help.

No additional sources used - 

We spent about 10 hours on this assignment.

Your assessment of the assignment:

to do. They enjoyed it. The design of a web app was exciting to complete and see come to life.
